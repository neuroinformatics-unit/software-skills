# Image Analysis in Python

## Overview
This half day course will introduce the use of Python packages to analyse (numpy, scipy & scikit-image) and visualise (napari) image data.

The aim will be to carry out basic image analysis and visualisation tasks using Python, and create a napari plugin to share the workflow with others.
