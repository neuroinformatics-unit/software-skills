# Image Analysis in Python

## Overview
This half-day course will introduce the use of Python packages to analyse and visualise image data common to neuroscience.

## Course Summary:

- **Interactive workflows in Python:**
    - IPython for efficient data exploration

- **Basic image analysis techniques:**
    - Utilizing NumPy, and scikit-image libraries
    - Visualization and exploration with napari

- **Processing large datasets effectively:**
    - Introduction to Dask for parallel computing
    - Demonstration using BrainSaw data

- **Tools for processing histology data:**
    - BrainGlobe tools for image registration and segmentation

:::{note}
If time allows, we will also look at using convolutional neural networks for tricky segmentation problems.
