# Running pose estimation on the SWC HPC system

## Overview
This course will briefly introduce the SWC HPC system and then cover how to run pose estimation at scale on the HPC.

## Prerequisites
This course will teach HPC usage using video behavioural analysis as an example workflow. Ideally, students should have 
an understanding of pose estimation tools, e.g. by attending the [Video behavioural analysis](./video-analysis) course.

Students should bring their own laptop with Python installed. If you require any assistance, please contact
