# Collaborative coding and software development good practices

## Overview
The course will teach the first steps to go beyond a simple Python script and create maintainable, 
high-quality software. It will provide a hands-on introduction to:
* Making Python code easy to install by others
* Working collaboratively on code
* Documenting code
* Testing code
* Evaluating and improving code quality


## Prerequisites
Students should have some initial experience with both Python and version control using Git, e.g. by attending the 
[Introduction to software development in Python](./intro-software-dev.md) course.

Students should bring their own laptop with Python installed. If you require any assistance, please contact
<a href="mailto:adam.tyson@ucl.ac.uk?subject=SWC/GCNU Software Skills">Adam Tyson</a> in advance of the course.

They should also follow [these setup instructions](https://github.com/rse-best-practices-course-2023/rse-best-practices-playground/issues/1) in advance of the course.
