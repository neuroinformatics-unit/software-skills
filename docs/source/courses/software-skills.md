## Introduction to Python
The aim of the course is to introduce basic concepts of programming in Python, and establish a community of Python users. It is a hands-on course, in which we will guide you 
through the process of writing your first Python script and teach you some best practices.

The course will run over two days, 2.5-3h per day with a break in between.

Full details can be found on the [course webpage](https://software-skills.neuroinformatics.dev/courses/intro-software-dev.html)

Instructors: Igor Tatarnikov, Sofía Miñano

## Data Management and Sharing

 This course will introduce best-practices in neuroscience data management 
 and cover recent standardisation initiatives. The primary take-away from this course 
 will be to leave with a strong schema in mind for clean organisation of experimental data.

Full details can be found on the [course webpage](https://software-skills.neuroinformatics.dev/courses/data-management.html)

## Version control and software development best practices

The aims of the course are
* to learn how to keep track of changes to your code with Git and GitHub, 
* to learn how to structure your code well
* and to get an initial idea of how work collaboratively on a code base, and how to document and test your code.

Instructors: Stephen Lenzi, Laura Porta, Alessandro Felder

## Video-based analysis of animal behaviour

This course will introduce the theory and practice of tracking animals in videos to quantify their behaviour.
Participants will get to train pose estimation models
with [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/), analyse pose tracks
with [movement](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/), and extract behavioural syllables with [keypoint-moseq](https://keypoint-moseq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 

Full details can be found on the [course webpage](video-analysis).

Instructors: Niko Sirmpilatze, Chang Huan Lo, Sofía Miñano

## Linux and high-performance computing
This course will introduce some basic principles of using Linux, and high-performance computing in general. Most of 
the course will be centered around learning to run a specific workflow (pose estimation) on the SWC HPC system. 

Full details can be found on the [course webpage](hpc-behaviour).

Instructors: Niko Sirmpilatze, Igor Tatarnikov, Adam Tyson

## General microscopy
This course will introduce some basic concepts about microscopy (optics, fluroescence etc.) to help better understand 
the following course on histology analysis.

Instructors: Rob Campbell, Adam Tyson, Alessandro Felder, Igor Tatarnikov


## Histology analysis
