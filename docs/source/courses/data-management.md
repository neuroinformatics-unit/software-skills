# Data management and sharing

## Overview

Standardised project folders facilitate data sharing and collaborationâ€”as well as making daily life easier for researchers. This course will introduce current best-practices in neuroscience data management and recent standardisation initiatives.
The primary take-away from this course will be to leave with a strong schema in mind for clean organisation of experimental project data. 

[NeuroBlueprint](https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/), a specification developed here at the SWC to aid standardisation of datasets across the institute, will be covered in detail. 
Familiarity with NeuroBlueprint will also be beneficial in that all analysis pipelines the NIU develop will be designed to work with data organised to NeuroBlueprint. 

We will also cover `datashuttle`, a tool developed to assist in creating and transferring data organised to the NeuroBlueprint standard.

## Prerequisites
Students should bring their own laptop. For the second part of the course covering `datashuttle`. Python and conda / miniconda must be installed.
