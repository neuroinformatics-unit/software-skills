# Turning your Python scripts into reusable, general-purpose software

### Overview
When using Python, you will use many external packages (pandas, numpy etc.). This course will introduce how to develop your software into a general-purpose tool that can be used inside or outside a Python environment. We will also cover some tools to make developing robust, maintainable code a bit easier.

For this course you will need a very basic knowledge of Python, and a laptop with conda (miniconda or anaconda) installed. If you need any help prior to the course (e.g. if you have a different Python installation) contact Adam Tyson (adam.tyson@ucl.ac.uk).
