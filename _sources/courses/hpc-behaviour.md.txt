# Running pose estimation on the SWC HPC system

## Overview
This course will briefly introduce the SWC HPC system and then cover how to run pose estimation at scale on the HPC.

## Prerequisites
This course will teach HPC usage using video behavioural analysis as an example workflow. Ideally, students should have 
an understanding of pose estimation tools, e.g. by attending the [Video-based analysis of animal behaviour](./video-analysis) course.

Students should bring their own laptop with Python installed. They should also possess
an SWC username and password and be able to 
[log into the SWC's HPC cluster](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/SSC/SitePages/SSC-Logging-into-the-Cluster-194972967.aspx).
